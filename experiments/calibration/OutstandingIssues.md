# Outstanding issues

* As the model runs forward in time and the behaviour of the disease evolves, the parameterisation of the model may need to change in order to predict accurately. Dynamic calibration of the model, whereby as new data becomes available 
* 
* 
* The aim is to dynamically calibrate the model parameters, so that as the disease evolves over time, and the values of the parameters might change



* Q: if we are assuming that parameter values change over time, then surely applying them over the whole time period always starting from day 0, is not optimal??
