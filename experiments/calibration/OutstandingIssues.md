# Outstanding issues

* As the model runs forward in time and the behaviour of the disease evolves, the parameterisation of the model may need to change in order to make accurate predictions. To allow for this, the model is set up to run with dynamic calibration. The model is run with ABC over 14 day intervals. After the first 14 day period the posterior estimate of the parameter values is then used as a prior for the next 14 days. However, currently, instead of the model continuing to run from day 15 in the second interval, it starts again from day 0 and continues up to day 28, and then in the next instance starts from day 0 and continues up to day 42. Given the assumption that parameter values are changing over time, this is not optimal, as we are always calibrating on the whole time period, rather than just the last 14 days.
