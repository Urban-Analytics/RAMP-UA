        # ********** How to assign activities for the population **********
        #
        # For each 'activity' (e.g shopping), we need to store the following things:
        #
        # 1. A data frame of the places where the activities take place (e.g. a list of shops). Refered to as
        # the 'locations' dataframe. Importantly this will have a 'Danger' column which records whether infected
        # people have visited the location.
        #
        # 2. Columns in the individuals data frame that says which locations each individual is likely to do that
        # activity (a list of 'venues'), how likely they are to do to the activity (a list of 'flows'), and the
        # duration spent doing the activity.
        #
        # For most activities, there are a number of different possible locations that the individual
        # could visit. The 'venues' column stores a list of indexes to the locations dataframe. E.g. one individual
        # might have venues=[2,54,19]. Those numbers refer to the *row numbers* of locations in the locations
        # dataframe. So venue '2' is the third venue in the list of all the locaitons associated with that activity.
        # Flows are also a list, e.g. for that individual the flows might be flows=[0.8,0.1,0.1] which means they
        # are most likely to go to venue with index 2, and less likely to go to the other two.
        #
        # For some activities, e.g. 'being at home', each individual has only a single location and one flow, so their
        # venues and flows columns will only be single-element lists.
        #
        # For multi-venue activities, the process is as follows (easiest to see the retail or shopping example):
        # 1. Create a dataframe of individual locations and use a spatial interation model to estimate flows to those
        # locations, creating a flow matrix. E.g. the `read_retail_flows_data()` function
        # 2. Run through the flow matrix, assigning all individuals in each MSOA the appropriate flows. E.g. the
        # `add_individual_flows()` function.
        # 3. Create an `ActivityLocation` object to store information about these locations in a standard way.
        # When they are created, these `ActivityLocation` objects will also add another column
        # to the individuals dataframe that records the amount of time they spend doing the activity
        # (e.g. 'RETAIL_DURATION'). These raw numbers were attached earlier in `attach_time_use_and_health_data`.
        # (Again see the retail example below).
        # These ActivityLocation objects are stored in a dictionary (see `activity_locations` created above). This makes
        # it possible to run through all activities and calculate risks and dangers using the same code.
        #

        # For each type of activity (store, retail, etc), create ActivityLocation objects to keep all the
        # required information together.
