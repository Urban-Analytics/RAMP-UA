# QUANT_RAMP dummy data

This folder contains dummy QUANT_RAMP data that are similar to the full QUANT_RAMP data but only represent a few, arbitrarily chosen areas. 

The process of creating these data is a bit haphazard, but there are some instructions in the files [filter_data.py](filter_data.py) and [filter_data2.py](filter_data2.py).
Look at [filter_data.py](filter_data.py) first.
