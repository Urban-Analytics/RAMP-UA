Here is the supermarket allocation and list of outlets for Devon.  (Just a quick reminder â€“ line 1, output area and number of retail destinations (=10); line 2, top ten retail destinations in each area; line 3 distance to each retail destination (as above); line 4, per 1000 trips to each retail destination.  So for output area 1 (E02004129) 26.2% of trips go to supermarket 24 (Tesco Honiton Superstore) which is 7.4km away).
I have also included a list of output areas although these are as they in the microsimulation files/ standard national list.
